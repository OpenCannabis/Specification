## OpenCannabis Specification

The _Specification_ portion of the OpenCannabis project consists of a loose set of proposals, listed here, each in their own directory. "Specification" just means a document shared amongst project participants. Each one varies in terms of adopters, sponsors, and editorship.

For more details, see each sub directory. Read on for a basic structural tour.


### RFC Structure

Like the infamous [IETF _Internet Standards RFCs_](https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs):

> The goal of the OpenCannabis RFCs is to contain technical specifications and organizational notes for the legal cannabis industry.

The first document in this series, `OCP-03`, was written in 2015, and open-sourced in 2018, as part of a startup called Bloombox. It was soon followed by others, which constituted the "version 1.0" of the specification and protocol. At the time, it was just a collection of shared protocol buffers and a matching set of Markdown docs.

The name "RFC," as the IETF used it, originally stood for "Request For Comments," but now they are simply known as RFCs.


#### `1/C4` and `2/COSS`

To give the project initial structure and a working template for process, it is forked from [`2/COSS`](https://github.com/unprotocols/rfc), also known as _unprotocols_. The _Unprotocols RFC_ describes itself as:

> Unprotocols RFC is a repository for universal, cross-project protocols used in software development, ranging from workflow to technical ones.

`2/COSS` inlines `1/C4`, known as the _*Collective Code Construction Contract*_. `1/CF` defines itself as:

> The Collective Code Construction Contract (C4) is an evolution of the github.com Fork + Pull Model, aimed at providing an optimal collaboration model for free software projects.


#### `OCP03`: Core Specification

The _Core Specification_ defines the thesis for the project, along with goals, anti-goals, and contribution/ratification procedures for specs. Additionally, "core data models" are defined in this specification, which are shared freely among extension specifications. This is a good starting place to understand the rest of the spec in depth.


#### Acknowledgements

Thank you to Pieter Hintjens for the `1/C4` project, and Yurii Rashkovskii, as the editor of the `2/COSS` specification.
