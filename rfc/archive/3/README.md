# OpenCannabis Specification
- Version `1.0`
- Status: `RETIRED`

### Status of this Memo

This memo defines a protocol and model for the legal cannabis community: _OpenCannabis, version 1.0_. Distribution of
this memo is unlimited.

This specification's current status is considered `RAW`, i.e. pre-`DRAFT`.

### Abstract

This document describes an interoperable technical data specification tailored for the **worldwide legal cannabis
market**. As legal markets to buy, sell, cultivate and manufacture cannabis products come online, a need is emerging for
a universal way of connecting data systems and components that work with cannabis or cannabis-related data.

The primary vision of this specification is to reduce the friction and burden on cannabis technology providers in
connecting disparate systems and datasets.
