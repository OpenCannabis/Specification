// Enumerates types of non-abstract products known to the spec.
//
// All [`ProductKey`](#opencannabis.base.ProductKey) records carry a `ProductKind`, which broadly identifies the type of
// product referenced by the key. In polymorphic circumstances, a `oneof` field with concrete product types may also
// carry an identifying instance of this enumeration, which allows for code re-use when decoding generic menu data.
//
// #### Super kinds
// Each `ProductKind` is related to a taxonomic category by way of
// [`ProductSuperkind`](../core.md#opecannabis.core.ProductSuperkind). Via the `taxonomy` annotation, one can scan for
// these super-kinds and enforce constraints or apply other logic that effectively operates across multiple categories,
// based on regulatory boundaries.
//
// #### Concrete sub-kinds
// Some product kinds have concrete (contextually-specific) _sub-kinds_. Examples include `FLOWER` and `EXTRACT`. These
// sub-kinds are defined within the `opencannabis.products` package, with each expressed inline with the sibling model
// which it relates to.

  // Traditional buds or 'flower'-based products, essentially sold in bags or jars.

  // Pre-rolled items, generally made from flowers, like a cigarette - this would cover joints, etc.
  PREROLL = 200 [(core.meta_kind).taxonomy = CANNABIS_FLOWER];

  // Manufactured products that are concentrated from flowers in some manner, such as wax or oil.
  EXTRACT = 300 [(core.meta_kind).taxonomy = CANNABIS_EXTRACT];

  // Manufactured products that are edible, like drinks, snacks, candy, and food.

  // Tinctures, topicals, capsules, and other forms of manufactured cannabis.
